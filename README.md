## 📖 Introduction

This project demonstrates a comprehensive solution for **Agricultural Product Traceability** using Blockchain technology. The system ensures transparency, immutability, and trust across the supply chain—from farmers to consumers.

By scanning a QR code or entering a product ID, end-users can verify the origin, harvest date, and distribution path of the agricultural products.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Authentication:** Secure login for Farmers, Distributors, and Consumers.
* **Product Management:** Farmers can register new products and update harvest details on the blockchain.
* **Supply Chain Tracking:** Record every transaction and movement of the product (e.g., Farm → Distributor → Retailer).
* **Traceability:** Consumers can view the full history of a product to verify authenticity.
* **QR Code Scanning:** Built-in scanner for quick product lookup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Mobile App:** Flutter (Dart)
* **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (Ethereum Network)
* **Development Environment:** Hardhat / Truffle
* **Wallet Integration:** Metamask / WalletConnect
